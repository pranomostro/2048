What for?
=========

I am not entirely sure. It was for practice,
but I put some effort into making this small,
so I thought this deserved to be a standalone
program. Of course, it is not different from
all those other 2048 clones in c out there.
It is just for fun.

Requirements
============

make for the installation, and a c compiler.
I hope you are not surprised.

Installation
============

It is simply
	make install
nothing more.

License and Thanks
==================

I nearly always use the MIT license, because I had the
patience to read it.
Many thanks to Lorenz, my brother and sister, who
tested this extensively.
